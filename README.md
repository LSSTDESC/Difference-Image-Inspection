# Difference-Image-Inspection
An inspection and comparison of DC2 image differencing algorithms

This repository is currently a dumping ground as we collect ongoing work from various places. Better organization to come.

## Project Goals

1. Compare image subtraction techniques and understand in what ways each algorithm fails or misperforms on DC2 data.
2. Understand these failures on both a qualitative and mathematical level.
3. Draw informed conclusions on challenges we will face on DC2 and what can be done about them.
4. Possibly suggest improvements to the image subtraction pipeline that will be implimented for LSST
